## Identification
Defender flagged USER1 account as Impossible Travel when they logged in from the United States at 9:01pm then a successful login attempt from Switzerland occured at 9:50pm.

This is considered a Sign In risk because it is not physically possible to travel from the United States to Switzerland in 49 minutes.

## Analysis
I started the investigation by cross checking the Defender alert with Entra ID sign in logs around the same timestamp to confirm complete account compromise.
In Entra ID, I did not see any successful or even attempted logins from outside of the United States for USER1 account. 
I returned to Defender to dig deeper in to the alert.
I noticed that the activity type for the Switzerland activity was referecing sharing a file from OneDrive and adding USER1 to a group.
I ran the IP address through OSINT tools and it was not flagged as malicious.
I selected one of the Activity instances and Googled the Event description (sanitizing USER1 information). 
I learned that since the Source of the activity was showing App Connector, this likely explained that the activity was being performed but Microsofts cloud infrastruture services and not the user account itself. 
I learned the App Connectors often run from Microsoft datacenters not user locations. 
I learned that modifying groups activity was an administrative or directory action not a user action.

Once I put together that there was no confirmed account sign ins and the action originated from Microsoft infrastruture, I was confident to report that it was a false positive.

As an additonal safety measure, the Security Engineer turned MFA on for this user. No other action was taken,.
